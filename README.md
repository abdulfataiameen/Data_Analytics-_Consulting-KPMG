# Data Insights

### Bakground Information

The analysis plan has been accepted and it is time to move forward. We must present our results to the client once the model is built. Using interactive visualisations is a great way to showcase the key findings quickly and effectively. Rather than presenting a list of customers or a block of code, visuals can better express our thoughts and demonstrate the outcomes of the analysis.

### Tasks

1. To create an interactive and informative dashboard for the client, there are various tools that can be used such as Tableau and Microsoft BI.
2. The dashboard should contain a maximum of three views/tabs and should be visually appealing to keep the client engaged.
When presenting the findings from the analysis, 
3. It is important to focus on key trends in the underlying data and identify which customer segments have the highest customer value. Additionally, an appropriate marketing and growth strategy for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd should be proposed.
4. Finally, to gain a deeper understanding of customer preferences and the propensity to purchase the products, it may be beneficial to draw insights from external datasets.  This may allow for the development of more tailored strategies and more accurate predictions of customer behavior.

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has updateda new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation.The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is sure that, if correctly analysed, the data would reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is a long-standing client who specialises in high-quality bikes and accessible cycling accessories to riders. Their marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behaviour.

## Task

1. To analyse and recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation, using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions).

2. To build this recommendation, start with a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach which we will be taking. The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development; Interpretation.

3. To prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities â€“ i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting.
